about_1 = "JuiceBox Temporary File Host is a fast, simple way to share files without creating an account. Pick a retention period from 1 hour up to 14 days, upload files up to 500 MB, and instantly share lightweight expiring links. When the timer ends, files are automatically deleted. It’s perfect for quick hand‑offs, code snippets, screenshots, small archives, and any content you don’t want to keep online forever."
about_2 = "How it works: drag and drop or click to select files, choose a retention window, then copy the link once each upload completes. We limit each IP to a small number of active files to prevent abuse; delete an older item to free a slot. For a minimal experience, try the <a href='/simple'>no‑script uploader</a>. For details about limits, retention, thumbnails and moderation, read the <a href='/faq'>Frequently Asked Questions</a>. Our focus is speed, privacy and ease: no tracking pixels, no social logins, and no permanent storage, just quick, disposable sharing."
about_3 = "Privacy and safety: your IP is used only to associate uploads, enforce rate limits and handle abuse reports, and it is removed after related files expire. To report prohibited content or request removal, visit the <a href='/report'>Report form</a> page. Use of the service implies acceptance of our <a href='/terms'>Terms of Service</a>.
