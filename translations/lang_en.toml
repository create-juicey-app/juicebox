# FAQ page translations
faq_title = "JuiceBox FAQ"
faq_meta_description = "Frequently asked questions about JuiceBox temporary file host"
faq_lead = "Everything you usually ask before uploading."
faq_basics = "Basics"
faq_q1 = "What is JuiceBox?"
faq_a1 = "A tiny throw-it-in and grab-the-link temporary file host. Drop file → get link → share → it self-destructs later. No accounts needed."
faq_q2 = "Do I need an account?"
faq_a2 = "Nope. Ownership is tied to the Cloudflare client IP we see. That's only for 'can you delete this?', rate limiting and moderation. No profile, no password, no email, just IP."
faq_q3 = "What is the file size limit?"
faq_a3 = "Up to {max_size} per upload. Drop a folder? It's zipped in your browser first, and that ZIP still has to fit the {max_size} cap."
faq_q4 = "Which file types are blocked?"
faq_a4 = "Executables & script-ish stuff (.exe .dll .bat .cmd .com .js .ps1 .sh .php etc.). If it's likely to be weaponized or abused quickly, it's probably blocked."
faq_q5 = "Can I hotlink files?"
faq_a5 = "Yes. The link you get (/f/<id>) is direct and cacheable until the file expires. Paste freely. When time's up it just 404s."
faq_expiration = "Expiration"
faq_q6 = "When do files vanish?"
faq_a6 = "You pick a lifespan (1h → 14d). When the timer runs out: delete file + metadata, link goes poof. Like if you never uploaded it."
faq_q7 = "Can I extend a file's life?"
faq_a7 = "Not yet. Re-upload it with a longer retention if you need more time."
faq_q8 = "What happens after expiration?"
faq_a8 = "The file is removed, the record is gone, and the link returns 404."
faq_privacy = "Privacy & Security"
faq_q9 = "Do you log my actual IP?"
faq_a9 = "We store the Cloudflare provided client IP with each upload so you can delete your stuff and so abuse can be curbed plus it's deleted with the uploaded file. No behavioral tracking, selling, or creepy enrichment. If that’s still too much: don’t upload sensitive things. Why are you even concerned for privacy if you use Windows."
faq_q10 = "Are uploads encrypted?"
faq_a10 = "In transit: yes (TLS/HTTPS). On disk: no. Why? Moderation (need to see what's reported), simplicity, and hotlinked encrypted blobs would be pointless without a key system (which we don't want). So: don't treat it like a vault."
faq_q11 = "Do you scan malware?"
faq_a11 = "Right now: only basic extension blocking. If abuse spikes, a lightweight hash + VirusTotal style lookup pipeline may be added (will be announced). Basic rules of the internet, Don't run any suspicious things"
faq_q12 = "Can other people list my files?"
faq_a12 = "No public browsing. Someone would need the exact link. Guessing IDs at scale just hits rate limits and sadness."
faq_abuse = "Abuse & Limits"
faq_q13 = "Rate limits?"
faq_a13 = "Short bursts are fine (token bucket ≈ 60 burst, slowly refills). Might tweak this if abuse emerges"
faq_q14 = "Content rules?"
faq_a14 = "No illegal stuff, no malware, no private personal data you don't have permission to share, no hate / harassment. Edge cases? Ask (or assume 'no'). See Terms."
faq_banned = "Banned Content"
faq_q15 = "What content is disallowed?"
faq_a15 = "Illegal material, CSAM, sexualized minors, non-consensual intimate imagery, doxxing, malware/exploit droppers, extremist recruitment media, targeted hate, large copyrighted media you don't own, using the service as a long-term CDN dump."
faq_q16 = "Why these restrictions?"
faq_a16 = "Why are you even asking."
faq_q17 = "What happens if I upload banned content?"
faq_a17 = "Don't, I'll just delete it and probably IP ban you. Serious stuff may be escalated."
faq_removal = "Removal"
faq_q18 = "How do I delete a file early?"
faq_a18 = "Click the ❌ in the UI or send DELETE /d/<filename> from the same network. That's it."
faq_q19 = "Can staff remove files?"
faq_a19 = "Yes."
faq_api = "API Notes"
faq_q20 = "Is there an API?"
faq_a20 = "POST /upload with multipart file(s) + optional ttl. Returns JSON: { files: [\"f/abc123\"] }. That's the whole 'API.'"

terms_section_7_body = "Each upload stores: generated identifier, original filename, size, MIME/type guess, retention timestamp, and the edge IP token. On expiration or early deletion: metadata row is removed and the file is unlinked from disk storage. Residual low‑level filesystem artifacts (e.g., journal or snapshot traces) are not deliberately preserved. Backups-if present-are short‑lived and cyclic."
terms_section_8_heading = "8. Security Posture"
terms_section_8_body = "Transport uses HTTPS (TLS). Files are not encrypted at rest. No malware scanning or content hashing beyond simple extension filtering presently occurs. You should treat all downloaded content as untrusted and perform your own validation."
terms_section_9_heading = "9. Availability & Changes"
