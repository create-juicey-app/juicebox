# FAQ page translations
faq_title = "JuiceBox FAQ"
faq_meta_description = "Frequently asked questions about JuiceBox temporary file host"
faq_lead = "Detailed answers about retention, hashed ownership, moderation, and APIs."
faq_basics = "Basics"
faq_q1 = "What is JuiceBox?"
faq_a1 = "JuiceBox is a volunteer-run, open-source temporary file host. Drop a file, pick how long it should stay online, and share the link. When the timer ends, the file and its metadata are removed automatically. No accounts or personal onboarding required."
faq_q2 = "Do I need an account?"
faq_a2 = "No account system exists. Instead, the Cloudflare edge IP that reaches the origin is hashed with the secret <code>IP_HASH_SECRET</code> pepper (HMAC-SHA256). That anonymized token determines ownership, rate limits, and deletion rights. We never store the raw IP or any login credentials."
faq_q3 = "What is the file size limit?"
faq_a3 = "The default ceiling is {max_size} per file (read from the MAX_FILE_SIZE env variable). If you upload a folder, the browser turns it into a ZIP first and that archive must still fit within the cap."
faq_q4 = "Which file types are blocked?"
faq_a4 = "Anything executable or likely to be weaponized is blocked by extension, including .exe, .dll, .bat, .cmd, .com, .js, .ps1, .sh, .php, and similar script/binary formats. Additional extensions can be disallowed at any time if abuse emerges."
faq_q5 = "Can I hotlink files?"
faq_a5 = "Yes. Every successful upload returns a short link of the form /f/<id>. The objects are served directly and can be hotlinked or embedded until they expire, after which the URL returns 404."
faq_expiration = "Expiration"
faq_q6 = "When do files vanish?"
faq_a6 = "You choose a retention window between 1 hour and 14 days. A background worker watches expiry times and deletes the file plus its metadata once the timer hits zero."
faq_q7 = "Can I extend a file's life?"
faq_a7 = "Retention cannot be extended after an upload completes. If you need more time, re-upload the file with a longer TTL option before the original one expires."
faq_q8 = "What happens after expiration?"
faq_a8 = "Once the retention window passes, the file, chunk session state, and ownership hash are deleted. Anyone hitting the link sees a 404."
faq_privacy = "Privacy & Security"
faq_q9 = "Do you log my actual IP?"
faq_a9 = "Every request is tagged with an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the Cloudflare edge IP using the secret <code>IP_HASH_SECRET</code> pepper. We never log or store the raw address. The anonymized hash is removed automatically once all associated uploads, chunk sessions, and reports expire."
faq_q10 = "Are uploads encrypted?"
faq_a10 = "Transfers are encrypted in transit with HTTPS. Files are not encrypted at rest so moderators can process abuse reports and so hotlinks stay simple—treat JuiceBox like a disposable hand-off, not a vault. Encrypt sensitive content yourself before uploading."
faq_q11 = "Do you scan malware?"
faq_a11 = "We block obvious executable/script extensions and perform lightweight MIME sanity checks. There is no antivirus pipeline yet. Treat anything you download as untrusted and scan it yourself, just like receiving a file from a friend."
faq_q12 = "Can other people list my files?"
faq_a12 = "There is no listing or search feature. File IDs are random cuid2 strings, and rate limiting discourages brute-force guessing. Only someone with the exact link can access the file."
faq_abuse = "Abuse & Limits"
faq_q13 = "Rate limits?"
faq_a13 = "Uploads and downloads use a token-bucket limiter keyed to the hashed edge IP. Bursts of roughly 60 requests are fine, but sustained automation will slow down or receive 429s. Limits may be tuned as traffic patterns change."
faq_q14 = "Content rules?"
faq_a14 = "Follow the Terms: no illegal material, malware, doxxing, intimate images without consent, hate or harassment, or anything you lack permission to share. When unsure, err on the side of not uploading."
faq_banned = "Banned Content"
faq_q15 = "What content is disallowed?"
faq_a15 = "Banned examples: illegal material of any jurisdiction, CSAM or sexualized depictions of minors, non-consensual intimate imagery, doxxing and personal identifiers, malware and exploit kits, extremist propaganda, targeted hate, and bulk copyrighted works you do not control."
faq_q16 = "Why these restrictions?"
faq_a16 = "These rules keep the service online and compliant. JuiceBox is tiny—hosting dangerous or infringing material risks takedowns, legal action, or infrastructure bans for everyone."
faq_q17 = "What happens if I upload banned content?"
faq_a17 = "Prohibited uploads are deleted, the hashed owner may be blocked, and serious incidents can be escalated to hosts or relevant authorities."
faq_removal = "Removal"
faq_q18 = "How do I delete a file early?"
faq_a18 = "Use the ❌ delete button next to the file while connected through the same network, or send a DELETE request to /d/<id> with the same hashed ownership token. Both paths require the originating edge IP hash."
faq_q19 = "Can staff remove files?"
faq_a19 = "Yes. Administrators can remove files that violate policy or law, respond to valid legal notices, and preemptively block abuse."
faq_api = "API Notes"
faq_q20 = "Is there an API?"
faq_a20 = "Yes. Send a multipart/form-data POST to /upload with one or more file fields and an optional ttl field (values like 1h, 3d, 14d). The response is JSON: { \"files\": [\"f/abc123\"] }. Chunked uploads use /upload/chunk with the documented session workflow."
faq_q21 = "Retention field values?"
faq_a21 = "Valid ttl values: 1h, 3h, 12h, 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d. If you send something invalid, we default to 3d."
faq_feedback = "Need more clarity? Open an issue or send feedback through the repository."
faq_intro_label = "Service overview"
faq_intro_heading = "Quick facts before you upload"
faq_intro_body = "JuiceBox is designed for short-lived transfers. We hash the Cloudflare edge IP with a secret pepper, cap active files per IP, and purge everything automatically when the timer you choose expires. Review the highlights below before diving into the detailed questions."
faq_intro_point_1 = "Retention windows range from 1 hour to 14 days; expired files and metadata are deleted for good."
faq_intro_point_2 = "Uploads support single-shot and resumable chunk sessions. Stalled sessions are cleaned up in the background."
faq_intro_point_3 = "Ownership, rate limiting, and bans use an HMAC hash of the Cloudflare edge IP combined with the secret pepper. We never persist the raw address."
