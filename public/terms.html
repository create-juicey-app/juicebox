<div class="panel"><h2>1. Acceptance</h2><p>By uploading, accessing, hotlinking, or otherwise interacting with a file through JuiceBox you agree to these Terms and referenced policies. If you do not agree, do not use the service.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>2. Service Description</h2><p>JuiceBox is a lightweight, temporary object/file host. Files are stored without indexing for discovery, then automatically deleted after a user‑selected retention period (currently 1 hour to 14 days). The service is provided strictly on an <strong>"AS IS"</strong> and <strong>"AS AVAILABLE"</strong> basis: no uptime guarantees, redundancy guarantees, or suitability assurances are made.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>3. Definitions</h2><ul><li><strong>"You"</strong> – any individual or entity uploading or accessing content.</li><li><strong>"Content"</strong> – any file, data, metadata, or derivative link you cause to exist on the service.</li><li><strong>"Retention"</strong> – the TTL you select at upload time determining scheduled deletion.</li><li><strong>"Edge IP"</strong> – the Cloudflare network IP seen by the origin, used for coarse ownership grouping and rate limiting.</li></ul></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>4. Prohibited Content</h2><p>Uploading or distributing any of the following is strictly forbidden: illegal material; CSAM or sexualized depictions of minors; non‑consensual intimate imagery; doxxing or highly sensitive personal identifiers (government IDs, financial numbers, precise geolocation of private individuals); malware, droppers, exploit kits, or intentionally obfuscated payloads; extremist propaganda intended for recruitment; incitement or targeted harassment of protected classes; large copyrighted works you lack rights to share (full TV episodes, films, commercial software, paid course dumps); content intended to treat the service as a persistent CDN or bulk bandwidth offload.</p><p>Violation may result in immediate purging of files, blocking of further uploads, and-where required-reporting to competent authorities.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Verify you hold necessary rights or permission to publish the content.</li><li>Avoid uploading sensitive personal or regulated data (medical, financial, biometric, etc.).</li><li>Do not attempt to circumvent size, type, or rate limits.</li><li>Do not probe infrastructure, perform scraping at scale, or abuse hotlinking for high‑volume distribution.</li></ul></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>6. Privacy & Minimal Logging</h2><p>No account system exists. Ownership mapping and rate limiting use only the Cloudflare edge IP. Visitor IP headers are intentionally ignored. Limited rotated access logs may include timestamp, requested path, response code, size, and an anonymized token for abuse diagnostics. Logs are not mined for profiling.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>7. Data Handling & Retention</h2><p>Each upload stores: generated identifier, original filename, size, MIME/type guess, retention timestamp, and the edge IP token. On expiration or early deletion: metadata row is removed and the file is unlinked from disk storage. Residual low‑level filesystem artifacts (e.g., journal or snapshot traces) are not deliberately preserved. Backups-if present-are short‑lived and cyclic.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>8. Security Posture</h2><p>Transport uses HTTPS (TLS). Files are not encrypted at rest. No malware scanning or content hashing beyond simple extension filtering presently occurs. You should treat all downloaded content as untrusted and perform your own validation.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>9. Availability & Changes</h2><p>The service may suffer downtime, data loss, or feature changes. Retention windows, size limits, or blocked extensions can be adjusted without prior notice. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of revised terms.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>10. Early Removal & Moderation</h2><p>You may request early deletion via the UI or the documented deletion endpoint from the originating network. Administrators may remove content at discretion (e.g., abuse signals, legal request). Removed content will not be restored.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>11. Copyright / DMCA</h2><p>If you believe stored content infringes your rights, submit a notice including: identifying information of the work, the infringing link(s), a good‑faith statement of unauthorized use, and contact details. Valid reports can result in prompt removal of the referenced file(s). Counter‑notifications may be evaluated case‑by‑case where legally applicable.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>12. Disclaimer</h2><p>NO WARRANTIES-INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT-ARE PROVIDED. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK OF USING THE SERVICE.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2><p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the operator shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, nor any loss of data, profits, goodwill, or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>14. Indemnification</h2><p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the operator from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your content or misuse.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>15. Suspension / Termination</h2><p>Abuse, legal demand, or security concerns may trigger temporary or permanent refusal of service. Repeated violators may have upload capability blocked at the network layer.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>16. Transparency Note</h2><p>The project aims to keep logging minimal. Should legal compulsion (court order, valid warrant) require production of limited retained metadata, only the narrowest responsive data set will be provided. Users will be notified where legally permissible.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>17. Miscellaneous</h2><p>If any provision is unenforceable, remaining provisions remain in effect. Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver. These Terms do not create any partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship.</p></div>
<div class="panel"><h2>Contact</h2><p>Report abuse, security issues, or legal notices through the repository issue tracker or designated contact channel.</p></div>
